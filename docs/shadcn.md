# Creating UI components

Most UI components will be created via `[shadcn-ui]`, which has been aliased to `ui` script in this repo.

Simply a command such as

```bash
pnpm ui add button
```

to automatically install a new button component to `src/components/ui`.

Be sure to rename it to use React's recommended casing (PascalCase) before committing, as well as review the [best practices](./best-practices.md) when dealing with React in Astro.
